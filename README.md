Digital Clock with Light/Dark Mode
This project is a simple Digital Clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for beginner developers to explore DOM manipulation, date and time handling, and basic styling.

Features:
Real-Time Clock: Displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format, which updates every second.
Date Display: Shows the current date in the format Month Day, Year (e.g., January 23, 2025).
Day of the Week: Displays the current day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
Light/Dark Mode Toggle: A button allows users to switch between light and dark themes for better visibility or personal preference.
When the mode is toggled, the button's background and text colors dynamically update to match the theme.
